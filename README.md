# Leveraging AI for Application Rationalization using Conversational Interfaces

This project presents an intelligent solution for Application Rationalization within Enterprise Architecture by combining Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) through a chatbot interface. The solution assists stakeholders in determining whether to **Invest**, **Retire**, **Migrate**, or **Sustain** business applications based on various assessment indicators.
